# Regression-Model-On-Bike-Sharing-Dataset
This Project is Building a machine learning model of Regression on a dataset to predict whether there would be growth of there revenue of a bike sharing company after this pandemic situation of covid-19 ends. 
For this I have used a Linear Regression model for prediction. 
This model is done in python using the libraries such as Statmodels, Sklearn and data analysis libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc.
